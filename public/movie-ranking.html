<p>"Carpe Diem," or translated as Seize the Day. This movie is perfect for poets and romantic people.
    This teaches you about the importance of having a life that's beyond work and academics. As Socrates
    says, "An unexamined life is not worth living.</p>
<p>Favorite Quote: We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because 
    we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business,
    engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, 
    these are what we stay alive for.</p>

<h3>Soulmate (2023)</h3>

<p>This romantic film features an short-lived infatuation that became a deep love, discussing topics of 
    sacrifice, dreams, and eternity. The lines are well-crafted and gut-wretching but everything is beautiful.</p>
<p>Favorite Quote: You are every reason, every hope, and every dream I've ever had, and no matter what 
    happens to us in the future, everyday we are together is the greatest day of my life.</p>
